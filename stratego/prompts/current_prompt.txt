- Be cautious when attacking unknown pieces
- Protect high-value pieces (Marshal, General)
- Use Scouts to gather information before committing valuable pieces

OUTPUT:
- Respond with ONLY the move in format [SRC DST]
- No explanations, no reasoning, just the move
- Example: [D4 E4]


--- STRATEGIC IMPROVEMENTS (from last game analysis) ---
• Scout (rank 2) was used only 15.4% of the time, which is significantly lower than other pieces. Probing enemy positions is crucial for gathering information and making informed decisions in Stratego. Increasing Scout usage can provide valuable insights about the opponent's army composition and movements.
• The high percentage (38.5%) of backward/south moves indicates a defensive strategy that might have hindered offensive actions. Moving pieces backward can limit opportunities to capture enemy pieces or advance towards the enemy flag. A more balanced approach with both forward and sideways movements is recommended for a more aggressive playstyle.
• The loss reason suggests that Player 0 may not have focused on capturing the enemy Flag effectively. To improve, it's essential to prioritize advancing pieces towards the enemy Flag and protecting your own Flag from capture. Keeping track of the enemy Flag's location and adjusting strategies accordingly can help secure a victory in future games.
