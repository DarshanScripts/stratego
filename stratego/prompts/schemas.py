"""Prompt validation and evaluation schemas.

This module will contain functionality for:
- Validating prompt format and structure
- Comparing prompt performance across games
- Identifying effective vs ineffective prompt strategies
- Generating prompt performance reports

Status: Planned feature - implementation pending

# TODO: Implement prompt validation system that tracks:
#       1. Prompt version -> game outcome correlation
#       2. Invalid move frequency per prompt
#       3. Strategic behavior metrics (aggression, diversity, etc.)
#       4. A/B testing framework for prompt comparison
# Also, with this Schema testing, it should able to load external prompt in json or yaml file to implement.
