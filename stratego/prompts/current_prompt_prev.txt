--- STRATEGIC IMPROVEMENTS (from past games) ---
• Firstly, it is noteworthy that the Marshal (rank 10) was only moved three times out of twenty-nine turns, accounting for 20.0% of the total moves made. In Stratego, the Marshal is a crucial piece as it can defeat any other piece except the Spy and the Flag. Frequent use of the Marshal early in the game can help control enemy pieces and gain valuable information about their positions. To improve this strategy, consider moving the Marshal more frequently to take advantage of its high rank and defensive capabilities.
• Secondly, the data shows that the player repeated the move '[A1 B1]' four times, which might indicate a lack of exploration or a focus on a specific area of the board. In Stratego, it is essential to probe the enemy's positions and gather information about their piece placement. Repeating moves may limit this ability and make the player vulnerable to enemy attacks. To address this issue, try diversifying your movements and exploring different areas of the board to gain a better understanding of your opponent's strategy.
• Lastly, it is important to note that there were no invalid moves in this game log. However, given the rules of Stratego, it is crucial to avoid moving pieces diagonally, attempting to move the Flag or Bombs, and choosing opponent's pieces to move directly. These actions can lead to immediate defeat and should be avoided at all costs. To ensure a successful game, always remember to follow the rules carefully and plan your moves strategically to minimize mistakes and maximize your chances of capturing the enemy's Flag.
• Firstly, it is concerning to see that the Marshal (rank 10) was used in 77.8% of the valid moves made, as this indicates an over-reliance on this powerful piece early in the game.

To improve this strategy, consider using the Marshal more strategically by saving it for key moments when it can make a significant impact, such as defending your Flag or attacking high-value enemy pieces.
• Secondly, the data shows that the Spy (rank 1) was only used in 22.2% of the valid moves made, which is significantly lower than the Marshal's usage. The Spy is a versatile piece that can move multiple squares and defeat any enemy piece except the Marshal when attacking first. Its mobility makes it ideal for probing enemy positions and gathering information about their piece placement. To address this issue, consider using the Spy more frequently to explore different areas of the board and gain valuable insights into your opponent's strategy.
